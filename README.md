AMD FEMFX
v0.1.0

FEMFX is a multithreaded CPU library for deformable material physics, using 
the Finite Element Method (FEM).  Solid objects are represented as a mesh of 
tetrahedral elements, and each element has material parameters that control 
stiffness, how volume changes with deformation, and stress limits where 
fracture or plastic (permanent) deformation occur.  The model supports a 
wide range of materials and interactions between materials.  We intend for 
these features to complement rather than replace traditional rigid body 
physics.  The system is designed with the following considerations:

 * Fidelity: realistic-looking wood, metal, plastic, even glass, because 
   they bend and break according to stress as real materials do.
 * Deformation effects: non-rigid use cases such as soft-body objects, 
   bending or warping objects.   It is not just a visual effect, but 
   materials will resist or push back on other objects.
 * Changing material on the fly: you can change the settings to make the 
   same object behave very differently, e.g., turn gelatinous or melt
 * Interesting physics interactions for gameplay or puzzles

The library uses extensive multithreading to utilize multicore CPUs and benefit 
from the trend of increasing CPU core counts.

Included in this release
* Source code for FEMFX library
* Houdini plugin for content creation
* Sample code for loading and preprocessing content for rendering
* Sample threading utilities
* A basic graphical sample

In a separate release, we provide a plugin for Unreal Engine that
demonstrates more advanced rendering of FEM objects. Instructions for access are here: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/GameEngineIntegrations
* Plugin: https://github.com/GPUOpenSoftware/UnrealEngine/tree/FEMFX-4.18
* Demo: https://github.com/GPUOpenSoftware/UnrealEngine/tree/FEMFX-AlienPods

Dependencies
The sample code has some dependencies on external frameworks which must be 
downloaded separately:
* JSON for Modern C++: https://github.com/nlohmann/json
* GLFW: https://www.glfw.org/download.html
